I know that you are a nerd too. Don't lie. You like statistics and numbers.

Tinder allows you to download all of your profile data (like any other modern platform) as part of their self-service system (https://account.gotinder.com/download?type=google). This emails you a large weird ugly JSON file after two days, and this project can parse that file and read some interesting statistics from that (calculate averages)

Might add some other fun stats later or try to evaluate your profile pictures or whatever

Honestly I just wanted to write some dumb logic in GO and this was the only big json file I had in my downloads folder
